# Design and analysis algorithm
## Greedy Algorithm
- Greedy principle:  always make a locally best (greedy) action for constructing a solution.

- Two classic Problems:</br>1.Interval scheduling:  maximize the number of jobs one can do. </br>
		 2.Interval partitioning:  minimizing the number of classrooms. 

- Algorithm for the interval scheduling: </br>
      1. sorting all the jobs in the increasing order of finish time. </br>
      2. select jobs one by one subject to feasibility for scheduling problem.
- Algorithm for the interval partitioning:</br> 
      1. sorting all lectures in the increasing order of start time. </br>
     	2. arrange lecture one by one, donâ€™t open new rooms unless necessary.
